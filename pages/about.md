I am Philip, also known as **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>

I have been playing video games my entire life. To me, they are the ultimate form of art â€” and as any art, it is meant to be shared with others. My way of sharing is through virtual photography.

Pompous stuff aside, it's a fun and rewarding hobby. Whether you show game worlds as-is or get creative with all the awesome tools available, it's always nice to have someone unfamiliar with the industry look at your shots and say, "Damn, I didn't know video games were so cool!"

Professionally, I gravitate towards video game journalism, marketing and community management. Together with many passionate people, we have built loyal brotherhoods, hosted dozens of events like tournaments and contests, and turned beginner content creators into massive influencers. Great times!
